# Chapter 1: Praxis Forge - The Original Dream

In November 2024, I set out to build something ambitious: a personal development platform that would improve how people approach self-improvement. I called it **Praxis Forge**, and it represented everything I believed about the intersection of technology and human potential.

## The Vision

Praxis Forge wasn't just another task management app. It was designed as an integrated ecosystem for personal growth, with five core components:

### Forge Practices - Habit Formation System

A habit tracking system that would help users build and maintain positive behaviors. Unlike simple checkbox apps, this would understand the psychology of habit formation, provide insights into patterns, and adapt to individual learning styles.

### Praxis Paths - Goal Setting and Tracking

A goal management system that broke down large objectives into actionable steps, tracked progress with meaningful metrics, and provided guidance on maintaining momentum through difficult periods.

### Forge Rituals - Daily Task Management

Smart task management that understood the difference between urgent and important work, integrated with the habit system, and helped users build sustainable daily routines.

### Praxis Matrix - Progress Analytics

Advanced analytics and visualization showing how different aspects of personal development interconnected. This would reveal patterns in productivity, identify areas for improvement, and celebrate genuine progress.

### Forge Mastery - Skill Development

A system for tracking skill development across multiple domains, with spaced repetition for learning, progress tracking, and integration with real-world practice.

## The Technical Stack

I chose modern technologies that matched my ambitious vision:

### Frontend: Rust + Yew + WebAssembly

- **Rust** for type safety and performance
- **Yew** framework for reactive UI development
- **WebAssembly** for optimized performance in the browser
- **Tauri** for desktop application packaging

### Backend: Elixir + Phoenix

- **Elixir** for its legendary concurrency model and fault tolerance
- **Phoenix** for real-time web capabilities
- **Rust NIFs** for performance-critical operations
- **PostgreSQL** for robust data persistence

### Philosophy

This stack represented a commitment to both performance and developer experience. Rust would give us memory safety and speed, Elixir would handle concurrent users and real-time updates, and the combination would create something truly special.

## Early Development

The initial phase was exhilarating. I set up the project structure with multiple repositories:

- **`atlas-waypoints/`** - Project planning and issue tracking
- **`forge-core/`** - Elixir/Phoenix backend
- **`praxis-workshop/`** - Rust/Yew frontend (version 1)
- **`praxis-atlas/`** - Comprehensive documentation

The planning was meticulous. I created detailed database schemas, comprehensive architecture documentation, and even automated GitHub issue creation scripts. Everything felt organized and achievable.

## The First Signs of Complexity

As development progressed, I began to encounter the first hints of what would become major challenges:

### Framework Learning Curve

While Yew was powerful, the learning curve was steeper than expected. The React-like patterns were familiar, but translating them to Rust's ownership model created friction I hadn't anticipated.

### Integration Complexity

Connecting the Rust frontend to the Elixir backend required careful consideration of serialization, error handling, and state management across very different paradigms.

### Development Velocity

Build times for WebAssembly were longer than expected, and the iteration cycle was slower than I was used to with other web technologies.

## Seeds of Future Pivots

Even in these early days, I was already experimenting with alternatives. The `praxis-workshop-two/` directory contained explorations with Leptos, a newer Rust framework that promised reduced boilerplate and better performance characteristics.

This experimentation would prove crucial later, as it demonstrated an early willingness to challenge assumptions and explore better solutions when the current approach showed limitations.

## The Dream Intact

Despite early challenges, the vision remained clear and compelling. Praxis Forge represented not just a capstone project, but a genuine attempt to solve real problems in personal development using cutting-edge technology.

The comprehensive documentation in `praxis-atlas/` shows just how thoroughly I had thought through the system:

- Database ERD diagrams
- API specifications
- User experience flows
- Testing strategies
- Deployment plans

This wasn't a hobby project—it was a serious attempt to build production-ready software that could genuinely help people improve their lives.

## Looking Forward

What I didn't know at the time was that this careful planning and ambitious vision would soon collide with the realities of complex software development. The journey ahead would teach me as much about what not to do as what to do, and ultimately lead to insights about architecture and problem-solving that no amount of planning could have provided.

The dream of Praxis Forge was beautiful in its ambition and clear in its purpose. The story of what happened next—and why it transformed into something completely different—is where the real learning began.
