# Chapter 6: Building Nexus Flow

With the distributed architecture providing a solid foundation, the actual implementation of Nexus Flow could begin in earnest. This chapter chronicles the development of each service, the integration challenges solved, and the emergence of a production-ready AI-powered dream interpretation platform.

## The Development Strategy

The distributed architecture allowed for a strategic development approach:

### Sequential Service Development

1. **Symbol Ontology MCP Server** - Establish the knowledge base foundation
2. **Nexus Core API** - Build AI integration and data management
3. **Nexus Web Frontend** - Create the user experience layer

### Independent Testing and Validation

Each service could be developed and tested in isolation, with integration testing happening as a separate concern.

## Service 1: Symbol Ontology MCP Server

### Domain Modeling

The first step was establishing rich domain models for symbolic reasoning:

**Symbol Entity**

```rust
pub struct Symbol {
    pub id: String,
    pub name: String,
    pub category: String,
    pub description: String,
    pub interpretations: Vec<String>,
    pub related_symbols: Vec<String>,
}
```

**Symbol Sets for Ontological Organization**

```rust
pub struct SymbolSet {
    pub id: String,
    pub name: String,
    pub description: String,
    pub category: String,
    pub symbols: Vec<Symbol>,
}
```

### Repository Pattern Implementation

To support both development and production environments, I implemented a clean repository pattern:

**Repository Trait**

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait SymbolRepository {
    async fn search_symbols(&self, query: &str) -> Result<Vec<Symbol>>;
    async fn get_symbols_by_category(&self, category: &str) -> Result<Vec<Symbol>>;
    async fn get_all_symbols(&self) -> Result<Vec<Symbol>>;
}
```

**Multiple Implementations**

- **MemorySymbolRepository**: In-memory storage for development and testing
- **PostgresSymbolRepository**: Database-backed storage for production

### MCP Protocol Implementation

The Model Context Protocol integration required implementing the standardized communication patterns:

**Core MCP Methods**

- `get_symbols` - List all symbols with optional pagination
- `search_symbols` - Text-based symbol search
- `filter_by_category` - Category-based filtering
- `get_categories` - Available symbol categories
- `get_symbol_sets` - Ontological symbol groupings

**Transport Layer**
The MCP server supported multiple transport options:

- HTTP/JSON for RESTful access
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) for real-time AI tool integration

### Symbol Data Curation

Building a comprehensive symbol database required research and curation:

**Symbol Categories**

- **Dream Symbols**: Water, fire, flying, falling, animals, etc.
- **Archetypal Symbols**: Jung's universal symbols and meanings
- **Mythological Symbols**: Cross-cultural symbolic meanings
- **Personal Symbols**: Common personal associations

**Data Sources**

- Academic research on symbolic interpretation
- Jungian psychology literature
- Cross-cultural symbol dictionaries
- Dream interpretation traditions

## Service 2: Nexus Core (Backend API)

### AI Integration Architecture

The backend required sophisticated AI integration with multiple providers:

**Provider Trait System**

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait AiClientTrait {
    async fn interpret_dream(&self, dream_text: &str, symbols: Vec<Symbol>) -> Result<String>;
    async fn extract_symbols(&self, text: &str) -> Result<Vec<String>>;
}
```

**Multi-Provider Implementation**

- **OpenRouter Integration**: Primary AI provider for dream interpretation
- **GitHub/Azure Fallback**: Secondary provider for reliability
- **Graceful Degradation**: Friendly error messages when services are unavailable

### MCP Client Integration

Connecting to the Symbol Ontology required building an MCP client:

**MCP Client Trait**

```rust
#[async_trait]
pub trait McpClientTrait {
    async fn search_symbols(&self, query: &str) -> Result<Vec<Symbol>>;
    async fn get_symbol_categories(&self) -> Result<Vec<String>>;
}
```

**Implementation Details**

- Server-Sent Events transport for real-time communication
- Async trait objects for dependency injection
- Comprehensive error handling and retry logic

### Dream Processing Pipeline

The core business logic involved a sophisticated processing pipeline:

1. **Symbol Extraction**: Identify potential symbols in dream text
2. **Symbol Enhancement**: Query MCP server for symbolic meanings
3. **AI Interpretation**: Generate interpretation with symbolic context
4. **Result Assembly**: Combine AI response with symbol information

### Database Design

PostgreSQL provided robust storage for dreams and metadata:

**Dreams Table**

```sql
CREATE TABLE dreams (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    text TEXT NOT NULL,
    interpretation TEXT NOT NULL,
    symbols JSONB,
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT now()
);
```

**Full-Text Search**

- PostgreSQL's built-in full-text search for dream content
- Indexing strategies for performance
- Tag-based categorization system

### API Design

Clean REST endpoints provided frontend integration:

**Core Endpoints**

- `POST /api/interpret_dream` - Process dream for interpretation
- `POST /api/dreams` - Save dream and interpretation
- `GET /api/dreams` - List saved dreams with pagination
- `GET /api/dreams/:id` - Retrieve specific dream
- `GET /health` - Service health check

## Service 3: Nexus Web (Frontend)

### Leptos Client-Side Architecture

The frontend leveraged Leptos CSR for optimal development experience:

**Component Architecture**

- **Pages**: Route-level components (Home, Interpreter, Journal)
- **Components**: Reusable UI elements (forms, buttons, display)
- **Services**: API communication and state management

### Dream Interpretation Interface

The core user experience centered around dream interpretation:

**DreamInterpreter Component**

- Clean form for dream text submission
- "Common Dream Themes" for quick input
- Real-time interpretation display
- Loading states and error handling
- Tips for better dream recall

### Advanced Frontend Features

**Offline Capabilities**

```rust
// localStorage integration for offline dream access
pub async fn save_dream_locally(dream: &Dream) -> Result<()> {
    if let Some(storage) = web_sys::window()
        .and_then(|w| w.local_storage().ok())
        .flatten()
    {
        let dream_json = serde_json::to_string(dream)?;
        storage.set_item(&format!("dream_{}", dream.id), &dream_json)?;
    }
    Ok(())
}
```

**Responsive Design**

- Mobile-first CSS architecture
- Flexible grid layouts
- Touch-friendly interface elements
- Dark mode support

**Performance Optimization**

- WebAssembly compilation optimizations
- Lazy loading for large dream lists
- Efficient API caching strategies
- Minimal bundle size through selective feature inclusion

### WebAssembly Integration Patterns

**Platform-Aware Code**

```rust
#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]
fn get_api_base_url() -> String {
    // Browser-specific environment detection
    match web_sys::window()
        .and_then(|w| w.location().hostname().ok())
    {
        Some(hostname) if hostname.contains("localhost") =>
            "http://localhost:3003".to_string(),
        _ => "https://api.nexusflow.com".to_string(),
    }
}
```

**Browser API Integration**

- LocalStorage for offline persistence
- Window/Location API for environment detection
- Fetch API for HTTP requests
- History API for routing

## Integration Challenges and Solutions
