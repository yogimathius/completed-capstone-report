## üéØ **The Journey**

_Eight months. One vision. Countless lines of Rust._

This capstone report chronicles the complete development journey of **Nexus Flow** - from initial concept to production deployment. What started as an ambitious vision to build an AI-powered dream interpretation platform became a masterclass in modern distributed systems, full-stack Rust development, and real-world AI integration.
