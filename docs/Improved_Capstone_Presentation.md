---

## Slide 10: Key Learnings & Best Practices

**1. Framework Choice Matters Long-Term**

- Early decisions compound over months of development
- Evaluate based on ecosystem maturity, not just features
- Be willing to pivot when evidence shows problems

**2. Documentation Accelerates Development**

- Issue tracking saves hours on recurring problems
- Painpoints documentation helps architectural decisions
- Future developers (including yourself) benefit immensely

**3. Distributed > Monolithic for Complex Systems**

- Smaller, focused services are easier to develop and debug
- Clear boundaries reduce coupling and complexity
- Independent deployment and testing strategies

**4. Strategic Pivoting Prevents Sunk Cost Fallacy**

- Technical challenges often indicate architectural problems
- Market alignment matters as much as technical execution
- Sometimes the best solution is a different problem
