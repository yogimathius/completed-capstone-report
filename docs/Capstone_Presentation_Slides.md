## Slide 1: Opening - The Journey

**[1 minute]**

# From Personal Development to AI Dreams

## 8 Months of Technical Evolution

**November 2024 → April 2025**

- Started: Ambitious personal development platform
- Delivered: AI-powered dream interpretation system
- Journey: 3 strategic pivots, countless lessons learned

_"This is the story of learning to solve complex problems systematically"_

## Slide 2: The Evolution - Strategic Pivots

**[2 minutes]**

# Three Critical Pivots That Shaped Success

## Pivot 1: Framework Discovery

**Yew → Leptos** (Reduced boilerplate, better performance)

## Pivot 2: Scope Reality Check

**Ambitious platform → Focused implementation** (Integration complexity)

## Pivot 3: Architecture Revolution

**Monolithic SSR → Distributed microservices** (Development velocity)

**Key Learning**: _Recognizing architectural problems vs. implementation issues_

---

## Slide 3: Final Architecture - Production System

**[2 minutes]**

# Distributed Rust Architecture

```

**Three focused services, clear separation of concerns**

- Frontend: WebAssembly performance + responsive UI
- Backend: Multi-provider AI + PostgreSQL persistence
- MCP: Symbolic reasoning + contextual enhancement

## Slide 4: Technical Achievements Delivered

**[2 minutes]**

# Production-Ready Innovation

## 🚀 **Full-Stack Rust Mastery**

- WebAssembly frontend with offline capabilities
- Distributed backend services with Docker deployment
- Advanced error handling and graceful degradation

## 🤖 **Cutting-Edge AI Integration**

- Multi-provider fallback system (OpenRouter + GitHub/Azure)
- Model Context Protocol (MCP) implementation
- Symbol-enhanced interpretations beyond generic LLM responses

## ⚡ **Modern Web Performance**

- Platform-aware compilation (`#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]`)
- Optimized WASM builds with minimal bundle size
- Real-time UI updates with Leptos reactivity

---

## Slide 5: Biggest Technical Challenges

**[2 minutes]**

# What Nearly Broke the Project

## 🔥 **WASM Development Hell**

- **Problem**: 10-15 minute build times, cryptic errors, multi-GB artifacts
- **Solution**: Distributed architecture reduced complexity per component

## 💥 **GraphQL Integration Failure**

- **Problem**: Cynic client caused dramatic compilation bottlenecks
- **Solution**: Pivoted to RESTful API with simple HTTP integration

## 🧠 **SSR Framework Friction**

- **Problem**: Leptos SSR caused severe IDE feedback issues
- **Solution**: Separated into CSR frontend + dedicated API backend

**Meta-Learning**: _When development velocity drops, it's often architectural, not implementation_

---

## Slide 6: Growth Demonstrated

**[2 minutes]**

# From Struggling to Systematic Problem Solving

## **Before: Framework Battles**

- Fighting with build systems and type errors
- Spending days on configuration issues
